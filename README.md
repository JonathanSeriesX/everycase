# Finest Woven

This is a working repo for the [Finest Woven](https://everycase.org/) website.

The development of Finest Woven is being driven exclusively on pure enthusiasm and only happens when I have free time, so I can’t provide you with any timeframes (:

Current roadmap:

- Fix pages with older collections
- Fix image datasets
- Option to sort cases not only by device but also by collection (year)
- Ability to sign up (with Apple!) and manage your own collection
- More content (like my notes & thoughts)
- Bluesky page?
