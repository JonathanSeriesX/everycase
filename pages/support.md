# It's free real website!

And it respects visitors. That's why EveryCase:

- Does not track you in any way, shape, or form
- Does not embed personalized ads
- Does not use third-party tools such as Google Fonts that might compromise user privacy

And never ever will. It's also **dead fast**, **100% non-intrusive**, and uses privacy-preserving [Cloudflare Analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics).

I also promise to donate 10% of your contributions towards aiding Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦. The funds will be transferred directly to the squads fighting on the battlefield. They use these donations to purchase additional gear such as ballistic vests, diesel generators, drones, pickup trucks, and other necessary equipment.

However, if you prefer not to contribute towards this cause, please let me know by leaving a comment when making a donation, and I will respect your choice. Thanks.
