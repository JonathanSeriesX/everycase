# AirTag & Accessories

In Spring 2021, Apple released one of their most useful accessories yet: an AirTag tracker, destined to find all your items that are easy to lose. And surely enough, Apple also released numerous accessories alongside it!

Both the Silicone Loop and the Leather Loop were discontinued rather quickly, and only the Leather Key Ring remained in production. It was later replaced by the FineWoven Key Ring after the Wonderlust Apple Event in September 2023.

The Key Rings feature a beautiful stainless steel ring adorned with the “Designed by Apple in California” inscription, making them a charming little gift for Apple enthusiasts.  

## Pricing

Single AirTag costs \$29, and 4–pack costs \$99.

In the United States, the Silicone Loop launched at \$29, while the Leather Loop was priced at \$39. Both the Leather Key Ring and the FineWoven Key Ring have an MSRP of \$35.
