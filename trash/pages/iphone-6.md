# Accessories for iPhone 6, 6S & Plus

This was the first time Apple split line-up of their cases into Silicone and Leather models.  

## Pricing & Compatibility

Due to iPhone 6 [bendgate](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/24/17389220/apple-bendgate-internal-documents-iphone-6-plus), iPhone 6s series came with reengineered made out of 7000 series aluminium, which made 0.1 mm thicker. Despite that, cases for both models are perfectly intercompatible with both iPhones.

I personally used 6 Plus Soft Pink Leather Case with 6s Plus, and it fit perfectly.
