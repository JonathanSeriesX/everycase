# Hello there!

You may have heard about [EveryMac](https://everymac.com/), the old-school yet functional catalogue of Apple devices, complete with specs, order numbers, and more. You may have also used [Bandbreite](https://bandbreite.watch/), a sleek and modern app for collecting Apple Watch bands.

And you might have wondered: shouldn't there be at least one resource dedicated to device cases manufactured by Apple? Describing that [Pink Citrus Leather Sleeve](latest-iphone/iphone_12#leather-sleeve) you slide your iPhone 12 mini into every day?

Perhaps a website designed for people who have never lost a thing in their lives yet still bought an AirTag 4-pack with a bunch of [Loops](others/airtag) just to show off their love for California Poppy? For people who know that Apple is primarily a fashion house and only secondly a tech company?

I wondered too. Then I've decided to never wonder again and to build such a website; problem solved!

Welcome (:
