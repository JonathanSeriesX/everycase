# Accessories for iPads with Liquid Retina Display and a single camera

The initial line-up of Smart Covers released in 2018 had a fully flat backside, but subsequent models released in 2020 and later featured an Apple logo on the rear (right on top of the Apple logo on the back of the tablet itself).

The USB-C port on iPad Magic Keyboard only transmits power, not data.

iPad Pro 12.9″ 4th gen and 5th gen are 0.5 mm thicker than the first generation, so Apple had to release an updated keyboard with slightly different dimensions.

## Pricing & Compatibility

Accessories for iPad Air 10.9″ and first-gen iPad Pro 11″ are exclusive to these tablets and not compatible with other models, just like accessories for iPad Pro 12.9″.
