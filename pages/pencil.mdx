# Apple Pencil & its accessories

In September 2015, Apple went on to monopolise the digital artistry market — thus, the combination of the first-ever iPad Pro 12.9-inch and Apple Pencil was born. It worked perfectly well, but certainly did not provide a good user experience for charging and carrying the pencil alongside the tablet.

At WWDC 2017, with the release of new iPad Pros, Apple also introduced a range of leather iPad accessories — including matching Pencil Cases, which are designed to protect the pencil and prevent it from rolling away.

In 2018, Apple discontinued these and introduced Apple Pencil 2 — now with magnetic charging, instant pairing, and a slightly more pencil-like shape.

## Quirks

Interestingly, even though the Apple Pencil 1 was always sold under a single SKU, there were two visually different models. Initially, the Pencil featured a "Pencil" logo engraved in Helvetica Neue, in line with Apple's prevailing typography at the time. However, by the Summer of 2017, Apple updated the Pencil's design to showcase the "Pencil" logo in the San Francisco font, aligning with the aesthetics of the iPhone 7, iOS 12, and the 2017 iPad Pro era.

While these might technically fit the Pencil 2, they aren't as practical for it, given that the Pencil 2 is designed to attach directly to the tablet.

## In the Wild

The Apple Pencil is not just an accessory — it has its own range of accessories too.
