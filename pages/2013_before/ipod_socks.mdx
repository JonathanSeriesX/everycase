# iPod Socks — 6 pack

The one which started it all? I wonder how many times this phrase appears throughout this wiki.

On November 4, 2004, Apple released the **M9720G/B** — a set of six iPod socks that became an instant sensation. What's particularly nice about them is that you could get the entire set for just $29, so you didn't have to worry about choosing which ones to buy - you could just use whichever sock you liked.

In addition to the standard six-pack, there was also an exclusive [red iPod sock]() that was never made available for purchase. This limited-edition sock did not have a part number and was gifted to customers during the opening of the [Boylston Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2008/05/14The-Apple-Store-Boylston-Street-to-Open-Thursday-May-15/) on May 15, 2008. Here's a nice story about the red sock, again by Stephen: [The Forgotten iPod Sock](https://512pixels.net/2016/11/the-forgotten-ipod-sock/).
