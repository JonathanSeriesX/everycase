# iPod Touch Loop

On October 11, 2012, Apple released the iPod touch (5th generation, A1421) in 32 GB and 64 GB variants.

Among other things, Apple saw the iPod touch, with its all-new 5-megapixel camera module, as a potential replacement for “point-and-shoot” digital cameras (remember those?), which often featured a wrist strap. Apple decided to incorporate one into the iPod touch but in their signature over-engineered style. Thus, The Loop was born.

Oh, and did you know that it earned the [Red Dot Design Award](https://www.red-dot.org/project/ipod-touch-loop-7740)?

## Quirks

- In the box of the iPod touch, there was only one loop, which matched the colour of the device.
- If you bought the loop separately, it came in a pack of two: a white one and a coloured one.
- On May 30th, 2013, Apple released the iPod touch 5 (A1509) — a cut-down model with 16 GB of storage and no iSight camera. It did not support the loop.
- On April 17th, 2014, Apple quietly added a new loop colour: Space Grey.

## Acceptance

On July 15th, 2015, Apple released the iPod touch (6th generation), and it had one less button than it should…
