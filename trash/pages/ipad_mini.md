# Smart Cover for iPad mini

The Smart Cover was one of the signature features of the usual-sized iPad, so it was no surprise that Apple decided to bring it to the smaller model. The Smart Cover for the iPad mini featured three segments instead of four, and this design was later adopted for all future iPad covers & cases from Apple.

## Pricing & Compatibility

It was announced on October 11th, 2012, alongside the iPad mini itself, and retailed for \$39. Only polyurethane versions were available; Apple has not released leather smart covers for iPad mini.

iPad mini Smart Case cost \$69 (nice!).

These Smart Covers are only compatible with the iPad mini, iPad mini with Retina Display, and iPad mini 3. They won't fit later iPad minis because of slightly different dimensions (and magnet layouts).

Even though iPad mini 2 was 0.3 mm thicker than its predecessor, all iPad mini accessories are interchangeable between iPad mini 1, 2, and 3, but not later models.
