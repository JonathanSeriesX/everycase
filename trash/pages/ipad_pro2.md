# Accessories for iPads with Liquid Retina Display and a single camera

In 2018, it was time for a new iPad design, and it turned out quite well and recognizable. With it, came the new case design: Smart Folio, which covers both back and front of the device, but not the sides, unlike Smart Case.

The initial line-up of Smart Covers released in 2018 had a fully flat backside, but subsequent models released in 2020 and later featured an Apple logo on the rear (right on top of the Apple logo on the back of the tablet itself).

## Pricing & Compatibility
