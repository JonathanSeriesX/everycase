# iPhone 5s Leather Case

Year 2013 not only marked the release of iOS 7, the first-ever version that was designed with taste, but also saw the introduction of two new iPhones, and the first attempt by Apple to create official cases (not bumpers!) for the iPhone.

The flagship model, iPhone 5s, featured an incredible and earth-shattering Apple A7 chip, along with Touch ID, a seamless and secure way to unlock the device, and a lineup of six cases made from natural aniline dyed leather.

Because most of these cases had relatively bright colors, they developed leather patina rather quickly, giving them an incredible and unique look. However, this sometimes resulted in some dissatisfied customers.
