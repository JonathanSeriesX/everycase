# Credits and such

This website was carefully crafted on <span style={{color: 'pink'}}>**Lovedead**</span> island by [@Jonathunky](https://twitter.com/Jonathunky).

I would like to give special thanks to the following people and projects:

- [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), the site generation framework created by [Shu Ding](https://shud.in/). Nextra is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/main/LICENSE).
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which provides a reasonably generous free tier hosting plan.
- My dear friends, who helped me with suggestions, writing text, testing and more: Danila, Kostya, and Evgenii.
