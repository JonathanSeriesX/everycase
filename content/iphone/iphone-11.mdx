# iPhone 11 Pro & Pro Max cases

Unlike their cheaper dual-camera sibling, iPhone Pro models received full treatment from Apple with quite a few cases available.

## Pricing & Compatibility

Staying true to tradition, the iPhone 11 series Silicone Case and Clear Case were both tagged at \$49, with the Leather Case coming in at \$59.

These cases are exclusive to iPhone 11 Pro & Pro Max; they won't fit iPhone X models.
