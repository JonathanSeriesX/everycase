# Accessories for iPhone XR & 11

In 2017, Apple began the tradition of releasing multiple phones simultaneously — mid-range and flagship. In 2018, they introduced a new kind of mid-range device: the iPhone XR, which was later succeeded by the iPhone 11. These devices featured a lacklustre IPS screen instead of OLED, an aluminium frame instead of stainless steel, and no telephoto lens, among other downgrades.

For some reason, Apple did not treat the XR and 11 like their usual iPhones and largely overlooked them in terms of accessories.

For the iPhone XR, Apple introduced a Clear Case — a new design presumably made to showcase the available colours. They also released a Smart Battery Case for it.

For the iPhone 11, Apple followed a similar path but also introduced two Silicone Cases: Black and White.

Both battery cases for the iPhone XR and 11 supported fast charging from USB-C PD sources, as well as Qi wireless charging. Oh, and the one for XR was recalled: https://9to5mac.com/2020/01/13/get-iphone-smart-battery-case-replaced-free/

## Compatibility

Cases for iPhone XR are exclusive to iPhone XR.

Cases for iPhone 11 can be used with both iPhone 11 and iPhone XR, though they will look weird on XR because of the different camera cutouts.
