# Development plans

As of November 2024, the development is being driven on pure enthusiasm and only happens when I have free time, so I
can't provide you with any timeframes (:

Anyway, list of upcoming stuff includes:

- Ability to sign up (with Apple!) and manage your own collections
- Option to sort cases not only by device but also by collection (year)
- Bluesky page
- More content (like my notes & thoughts)
- Improvements to images (I do transparent backgrounds manually.......)
