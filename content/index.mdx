  As of Nov 2025, I've finally upgraded the website to the Nextra 4 framework!
  More improvements are on the way (:{" "}

You’ve stumbled upon a unique space dedicated to cataloging every accessory Apple has ever crafted.
Accessories are an integral part of Apple’s design story, and I believe they [deserve](why.md) their own spotlight.

How to explore:

- Search for a specific accessory by SKU or product name 🏹
- Use the sidebar to browse, currently organized by device 👈

Enjoy, and thank you for visiting!

Here's my Pink Citrus setup, btw:
