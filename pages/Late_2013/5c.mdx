# iPhone 5c Case & 5c Dock

In 2013, we witnessed an extraordinary moment: the release of the most vibrant iPhone yet, whose liveliness remains unbeaten to this day. Colorful iPhone 5c complemented your look and made you the center of attention; distinctiveness of this design ensured that if anyone forgot the phone in the office kitchen, there was no mistaking to _whom_ it belonged.

## Pricing / Availability

Both cases and Dock were initially retailed for $29, but they quickly received discounts back in the day. Despite that, they are still easy to find because the iPhone 5c has failed to gain traction, sadly.

## Compatibility

These cases are only compatible with iPhone 5c.
