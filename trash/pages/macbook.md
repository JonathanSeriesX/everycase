# MacBook Leather Sleeve

## In the Wild

## Pricing / Availability

The first two MacBook Sleeves came out in Late 2017 — Midnight Blue and Saddle Brown for a 12-inch MacBook. These retailed for \$149.

In July 2018, Apple released a Black Sleeve for 12-inch MacBook, and sleeves in all three colours for a 13-inch (\$179) and 15-inch MacBook Pro (\$199).

On November 2019 Apple added Leather Sleeve for the just-released 16-inch MacBook Pro, also for \$199.

These are not exactly hot items, so it's still reasonably easy to find them even in shops.

## Compatibility

Everything fits if you are brave enough… except for the MacBook in Leather Sleeve; these sleeves are perfectly aligned for the respective MacBook models, so they are highly unlikely to fit, say, the latest 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros.

Guess that's why they still sell M2 13-inch MacBook Pro…
