## Hello there!

So you may have heard about [EveryMac](https://everymac.com/), the old-school yet functional catalogue of Apple devices, complete with specs, order numbers, and more. You may have also used [Bandbreite](https://bandbreite.watch/), a sleek and modern app for collecting Apple Watch bands.

And you kept wondering: shouldn't there be at least one resource dedicated to device cases manufactured by Apple? About that [Pink Citrus Leather Sleeve](iphone_12#Late_2020) you slide your iPhone 12 mini into every day?

A website designed for people who have never lost a thing in their life yet still bought an [AirTag 4-pack](airtag#Late_2021) with a bunch of accessories just to show off their love for Wisteria?

Here's the thing: Apple is primarily a fashion house, and secondly a tech company. So yeah, I kept wondering, too. Then I've decided to never wonder again and to build such a website. The problem is solved now.

Welcome!
