# State of Case

I first envisioned FineWoven Empire in the spring of 2023 and finally launched it to the public on October 18th, 2023. If you're reading this, it signifies that the website has already reached Early Access milestone. How wonderful!

Iâ€™ll keep introducing fixes, improvements, and new collections â€” whenever Apple releases them.

#### Plans for foreseeable future include:

- Adding more case images (I'm manually doing transparent backgrounds ðŸ¥²)
- Increasing image quality â€” as soon as [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KdlJlHAAbQ) [company](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETXQUkp-VOg) implements AVIF in Microsoft Edge
- Improving code (comments, readability, etc.)
- Localizations of FineWoven Empire to other languages
- More bad writing ðŸ¤—
- Small tweaks and fixes here and there

#### Long-term ideas:

Should the stars align â€“ say, this site garners immense traction, and I find myself both swimming in free time and eager to delve further into web development â€“ I'll start building FineWoven Empire 2.0. Expect this iteration to be more dynamic, interactive, and packed with features tailored for collectors.

I'm new to web development, and Iâ€™ll have to learn a lot, so this will take significant effort and time.
