# iPhone 14 case line-up

On September 7, 2022, Apple got rid of the only reasonably-sized iPhone model, and also introduced the Dynamic Island, which is a nice and elegant way to hide the camera and Face ID sensors.

Oh, and they announced some new phones. And some new cases. See below!

## Pricing & Compatibility

As it goes, the iPhone 14 Silicone Case and Clear Case will set you back \$49, while the Leather Case is priced at \$59.

iPhone 14 models feature a slightly different button layout, so they are not compatible with cases made for the iPhone 13.
