# 2013 | Leather 
For the iPhone 5s, iPad Air, and iPad mini with Retina Display, Apple released official leather cases made from premium aniline-dyed leather. These cases were designed to fit snugly on the devices while maintaining a relatively slim profile. They featured precise cutouts for buttons and ports, as well as a soft microfiber lining for added protection. 

These leather cases were designed to age beautifully, as the material develops a unique patina over time. This natural process enhances the appearance of the leather, giving it a rich and distinctive character that reflects its use and personal history.
