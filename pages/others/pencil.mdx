# Apple Pencil & its accessories

In September 2015, Apple went on to overtake the digital artistry market — thus, the combination of the first-ever iPad Pro 12.9-inch and Apple Pencil was born. It worked perfectly well, but certainly did not provide a good user experience for charging and carrying the pencil alongside the tablet.

Interestingly, even though the Apple Pencil 1 was always sold under a single SKU, there were two visually different models. Initially, the Pencil featured a “Pencil” logo engraved in Helvetica Neue, in line with Apple's prevailing typography at the time. However, by the Summer of 2017, Apple updated the Pencil's design to showcase the “Pencil” logo in the San Francisco font, aligning with the aesthetics of the iPhone 7, iOS 12, and the 2017 iPad Pro era.

At WWDC 2017, with the release of new iPad Pros, Apple also introduced a range of leather iPad accessories — including matching Pencil Cases, which are designed to protect the pencil and prevent it from rolling away. Here's a quick [video review](https://youtu.be/KVaNWcEjRRQ) of it.

In October 2018, Apple discontinued these and introduced Apple Pencil 2 — now with magnetic charging, instant pairing, and a slightly more pencil-like shape.

And in October 2023, instead of unveiling new iPads, Apple introduced a… more affordable Apple Pencil? Well, yes — it is a new model that now has USB-C port instead of magnetic charging and does not support pressure sensitivity. It is intended as a more affordable option for just jotting down notes and such.
