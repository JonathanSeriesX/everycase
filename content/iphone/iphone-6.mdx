# Accessories for iPhone 6, 6S & Plus

This was the first time Apple split line-up of their cases into Silicone and Leather models.

## Pricing & Compatibility

Due to [iPhone 6 bendgate](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/24/17389220/apple-bendgate-internal-documents-iphone-6-plus), iPhone 6s series came with reengineered chassis made out of 7000 series aluminium, which made phone 0.1 mm thicker.

Despite that, cases for both models are perfectly intercompatible with both iPhones.

I personally used 6 Plus Soft Pink Leather Case with 6s Plus, and it fit perfectly.
