# iPad Case

When the first-generation iPad was released on March 12, 2010, Apple also released a few accessories for it, including The Case â€” **MC361ZM/B**. This means that iPad cases actually preceded iPhone cases!

It folds in just the right places to act as a stand that holds iPad at an ideal angle for watching videos and slideshows or for typing on the onscreen keyboard. The case closes like a book. It's not too dissimilar from the iPad Smart Cases that came out later, but the cover of this one did not fold into a triangle.

Nowadays, the iPad Case case has become somewhat of a collector's item and can fetch relatively high prices on the second-hand market.
