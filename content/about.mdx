# Credits and such

This website is being meticulously crafted on <span style={{color: 'pink'}}>**Lovedead**</span> island by [@JonathanSeriesX](https://x.com/JonathanSeriesX), fueled by the influence of some epic [drum'n'bass](https://music.apple.com/tr/playlist/174-bpm-unsorted/pl.u-GgA52K5t8lplvr).

I would like to extend special thanks to the following individuals and projects:

- [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), a cool site generation framework created by [Shu Ding](https://shud.in/). Nextra is released under the [MIT loicense](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/main/LICENSE).
- [Tofino](https://alannamunro.com/fonts/tofino/), an incredibly beautiful font created by [Alanna Munro](https://alannamunro.com/), which is used throughout this website.
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/) for its generous [R2 Storage](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/r2/) free tier and privacy–respecting [analytics](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/web-analytics/).
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for database hosting with reasonably generous free tier.
- [yet-another-react-lightbox](https://yet-another-react-lightbox.com) for making what seems to be the best open-source React lightbox component.
