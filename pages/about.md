# Credits and such
This website was carefully crafted on <span style="color:pink">**Lovedead**</span> island by [@Jonathunky](https://twitter.com/Jonathunky).

I would like to give a special thanks to the following people and projects:

- [Nextra](https://nextra.site/), the site generation framework created by [Shu Ding](https://shud.in/). Nextra is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/shuding/nextra/blob/main/LICENSE).
- [Fly.io](https://fly.io/), which provides a very generous free tier hosting plan and is the only provider offering three hosting locations.
- My dear friends, who helped us with testing, writing text, and more.
