# MacBook Leather Sleeve

Some people cherish small rituals, and extracting your MacBook from such Sleeve can certainly infuse a touch of flair into your daily routine.

## Pricing / Availability

The first two MacBook Sleeves came out in Late 2017 â€” Midnight Blue and Saddle Brown for a 12-inch MacBook. These retailed for \$149.

In July 2018, with no connection to any particular event, Apple released a Black Sleeve for 12-inch MacBook, and sleeves in all three colours for a 13â€³ (\$179) and 15â€³ MacBook Pro (\$199).

In November 2019, Apple added Leather Sleeve options for the newly-released 16â€³ MacBook Pro, priced at \$199.

These are not exactly hot items, so it's still reasonably easy to find them even in retail shops to this date, still unsold.

## Compatibility

These sleeves are perfectly aligned for the respective MacBook models, so it's highly unlikely they'll accomodate the latest thicker 14â€³ and 16â€³ MacBook Pros.

And trust me on this: this is the only reason why Apple continues to sell the M2 13â€³ MacBook Pro ðŸ¤¯
