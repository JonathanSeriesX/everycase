# Accessories for iPad Air 1 & 2, iPad 5 & 6

On November 1, 2013, Apple released two very, very good iPads, one of which was the flagship model — iPad Air.
Its new design was mostly inspired by 2012's iPad mini, and it was reused in some way right until the release of the 10th generation 'just iPad' in Late 2022.

On its launch day, iPad Air received an accompanying collection of polyurethane Smart Covers and leather Smart Cases.

In 2017, Apple came out with a new budget tablet: just iPad (5th generation). It arrived with the host of new Smart Covers, which remained on sale until the discontinuation of the iPad (6th generation) in Late 2019.
