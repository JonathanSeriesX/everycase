# iPhone 15 case line-up

On September 13th, 2023, Apple announced iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Pro during Wonderlust Apple Event. It also marked Apple's move from leather accessories to new material called FineWoven, as part of the push for sustainability. And it did not go wellâ€¦

Customers and press were quick to voice their displeasure with new FineWoven Case: [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad), [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/25/apple-finewoven-cases-hands-on-terrible/).

## Pricing & Compatibility

iPhone 15 Silicone Case and Clear Case cost \$49, while FineWoven cases cost \$59.

iPhone 15 models features curvier corners than previous models, so cases made for iPhone 15 series are only compatible with corresponding iPhone 15.
