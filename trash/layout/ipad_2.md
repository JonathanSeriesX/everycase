# iPad Smart Cover

TODO mash together

Now that was some seriously revolutionary stuff.

March 25th, 2011, marked the release of iPad 2, which was tremendously improved on its predecessor in every meaningful way. Among these improvements was the introduction of Smart Covers, which enabled the iPad to be put into sleep mode when the cover was closed and to wake up when the cover was opened.

Here's the part about Smart Covers in AnandTech review: https://www.anandtech.com/show/4225/the-ipad-2-review/10. A “really neat accessory” indeed!

Apple offered two types of Smart Covers: Polyurethane covers for \$39.00, and for those seeking a touch of luxury, leather covers were available for a nice premium of \$69.00. Both types were compatible with the iPad 2, “the new iPad”, and iPad 4.

Apple came up with these incredibly cool posters to promote this accessory: https://www.oneclub.org/awards/theoneshow/-award/18010/ipad-smart-cover-launch-posters

# Smart Case for iPad

On June 11th, 2012, after WWDC, Apple quietly released the Smart Case for iPad. It's notable that before the date, there was no full-fledged case for 'the New iPad' and iPad 2; only the Cover, which looked pleasant, but offered little in terms of protection.

## Pricing / Availability

The iPad Smart Case was sold for \$49 — just \$10 more than Polyurethane Smart Cover, and \$20 less than Leather Smart Cover.

By the year 2015, Apple continued to produce and sell the Dark Grey version, while other colour options had been phased out and were no longer available for purchase.

## Compatibility

The Smart Case was compatible with iPad 2, iPad 3 'the new iPad', and iPad 4.
