# Smart Case for iPad
On June 11th, 2012, after WWDC, Apple quietly released the Smart Case for iPad. It's notable that before the date, there was no full-fledged case for 'the New iPad' and iPad 2; only the Cover, which looked nice, but offered little in terms of protection.

## Pricing / Availability
The iPad Smart Case was sold $49 â€” just $10 more than Polyurethane Smart Cover, and $20 less than Leather Smart Cover. 

By year 2015, Apple continued to produce and sell the Dark Grey version, while other color options had been phased out and were no longer available for purchase.

## Compatibility
The Smart Case was compatible with iPad 2, iPad 3 'the new iPad', and iPad 4.
