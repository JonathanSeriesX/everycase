# iPhone 13 case line-up

Another year, another iPhone lineup, another bunch of cases. Pretty nice colors, too; Wisteria is one my all-time favourites, it's just so nice. No more Leather Sleeves tho ):

## Pricing & Compatibility

True to form, the iPhone 13 Silicone Case and Clear Case are priced at \$49, while the Leather Case comes in at \$59.

iPhone 13 models feature a slightly bigger camera bump, so they are not compatible with cases made for the iPhone 12.
