# MagSafe Wallet

New accessory from Apple introduced in Late 2020, at the iPhone 12 event. Designed to hold up to 3 plastic cards inside, and attaches to the back of your iPhone.

MagSafe Wallet is shielded, so you have to pull your RFID / NFC cards out of it in order to use them.

The debate of whether it's easy to lose such wallet is still ongoing. If you use iPhone without the case, Wallet should be fine, as it is being held directly by phone's powerful magnets; however, if you use iPhone with the case, then the grip is somewhat weaker.

In 2021, the MagSafe Wallet was updated to include "Find My" capabilities. While it doesn't integrate with the broader [Find My network](https://developer.apple.com/find-my/), it can be linked to your Apple ID. As a result, if someone finds a lost wallet, they can view its associated information to help return it.

In 2023, as part of Apple's push for sustainability, Leather material was replaced with FineWoven.

## Pricing & Compatibility

Wallet's retail price is \$59. It is compatible with any iPhone 12 and later models, but not compatible with iPhone SE.
