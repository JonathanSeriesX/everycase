# Smart Case for iPad

On 2012, Apple released the Smart Case for iPad. It's notable that before the date, there was no full-fledged case for 'the New iPad' and iPad 2; only the Cover, which looked nice, but offered little in terms of protection.

The price was $49 â€” just $10 more than Polyurethane Smart Cover.

Of course, this is also compatible with iPad 4.
