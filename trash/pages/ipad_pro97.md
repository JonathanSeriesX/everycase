# Accessories for iPad Pro 9.7″

By Spring 2016, Apple went somewhat insane; while iPad Pro 9.7″ was a great successor to iPad Air 2, it had many exclusive features compared to iPad Pro 12.9″ (better DCI-P3 display with True Tone, more advanced radio with nicer antenna cutout, Rose Gold colour option, better cameras), while at the same time lacking some features of the higher-end model (fast charging, USB 3.0 Lightning, 4 GB of RAM). The iPad lineup become a notable mess and was only fixed by Summer 2017.

To support the Smart Keyboard connection, Apple had to split the Smart Case in half: it now consisted of a separate Smart Cover and Silicone Case. Sadly, the Smart Keyboard was only available in Black, so it was impossible to color-match it with fancy cases.

Notably, the bundle of Case and Cover cost much more than a single iPad Air Smart Case, and it was made from a cheaper material… but these accessories still looked incredibly cool.

Ultimately, this line-up of accessories was not successful, so Apple stopped doing full-body cases for iPad with later models.

## Pricing & Compatibility

Silicone Case launched for a nice \$69 MSRP in United States, while Smart Cover cost \$49 as usual.

Both Smart Covers and Silicone Cases for iPad Pro 9.7″ are exclusive to this model. Apple had to adjust the magnet layout in order to accommodate Smart Connector, so it's not compatible with iPad Air Smart Covers.
