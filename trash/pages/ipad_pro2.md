# Accessories for iPads with Liquid Retina Display and a single camera

In 2018, it was time for a new iPad design. The result was both distinctive and instantly recognizable; alongside it came the Smart Folio accessory, which covers both the front and back of the device, unlike Smart Case.

The initial line-up of Smart Folios released in 2018 had a fully flat backside, but subsequent models released after 2019 featured an Apple logo on the back, in the centre.

## Pricing & Compatibility

Accessories for iPad Air 10.9″ and first-gen iPad Pro 11″ are exclusive to these tablets and not compatible with other models, just like accessories for iPad Pro 12.9″ (3rd gen).

But these iPads are compatible with accessories for the [newer iPad Pro](latest-ipad/ipad_pro4).
