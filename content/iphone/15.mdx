# iPhone 15 case line-up

On September 13th, 2023, Apple announced iPhone 15 & iPhone 15 Pro during Wonderlust Apple Event. The long-awaited switch of iPhone to USB-C has finally happened… but not equally anticipated switch to smooth screens for the budget-model iPhones.

As part of push for sustainability (which, to be fair, looks real, unlike some other companies), Apple made the move from leather accessories to new material called FineWoven. Which is… [debatable](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/20/23882255/apple-iphone-15-finewoven-case-wallet-bad), [to](https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/25/apple-finewoven-cases-hands-on-terrible/) [say](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/) [the](https://www.macworld.com/article/2081435/iphone-15-finewoven-cases-criticism.html) [least](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics-computers/cell-phones/apple-finewoven-phone-case-review-a5814511909/).

FineWoven cases also seem to [stain](https://twitter.com/m_rlons/status/1708803532361531430) the MagSafe charger.

## Pricing & Compatibility

In the usual fashion, iPhone 15 Silicone Case and Clear Case are priced at \$49 in the United States, while FineWoven cases come in at \$59.

iPhone 15 models features curvier corners than previous models, so cases made for iPhone 15 series are only compatible with corresponding iPhone 15.
