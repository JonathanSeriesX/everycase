# Hello there!
 
So you may have heard about [EveryMac](https://everymac.com/), the old-school yet functional catalog of Apple devices, complete with specs, order numbers, and more.

You may have also used [Bandbreite](https://bandbreite.watch/), a sleek and modern app for collecting Apple Watch bands. 

And you kept wondering. Shouldn't there be at least one resource about device cases manufactured by Apple? Like that [Pink Citrus Leather Sleeve](Late_2020/sleeve/Pink_Citrus) you slide your iPhone 12 mini into every day? Or that [Peony Pink Leather Case](Late_2018/Peony_Pink/iphone_xs_leather) on your iPhone Xs, which you're still using as a backup because not all carriers support eSIM Quick Transfer, and you cannot just go to a carrier for a replacement SIM because it's kinda located on the other side of the planet?

Same with me, mate. Same with me.

So, I've decided to never wonder again and to build such website. Problem solved now.

Welcome!
