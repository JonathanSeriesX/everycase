# Development plans

The development of Finest Woven is being driven exclusively on pure enthusiasm and only happens when I have free time
, so I can't provide you with any timeframes (:

I plan to introduce following features by Spring 2025:

- Introduction of much more potent case view than just tables
- Ability to sign up (with Apple!) and manage your own collection
- Option to sort cases not only by device but also by collection (year)
- Bluesky page with cool content
- More content here on this site (like my notes & thoughts)
- More & more images (I do transparent backgrounds manually, it takes time.......)
