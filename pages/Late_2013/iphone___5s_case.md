# 5s Cases for iPhone

Alongside release of iOS 7, the first ever version that was designed with taste, came two new iPhones (also for the first time), and a whole lineup of cases made for them.

The flagship model — iPhone 5s — featured an incredible, earth-shattering Apple A7 chip; a CPU that crushed the competition, and was also first mass-produced aarch64 mobile CPU — and the Touch ID, seamless and secure way to unlock the device. Which, in the hindsight, lasted only four years; it was around for less time than Face ID — can you believe that?
