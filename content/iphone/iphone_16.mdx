# iPhone 16 case line-up

The iPhones just keep on coming, aren't they. Good news: no more FineWoven. Bad news: no premium kind of cases either. Pretty sure Apple will fix that gap by iPhone 17...

## Pricing & Compatibility

This time, every accessory comes in \$49, including Silicone Case, Clear Case, and the new Beats Case.

iPhone 16 Pro models features different size compared to 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 features different camera layout compared to 15, so these cases won't fit previous models.
