# MagSafe Wallet

New accessory from Apple introduced in Late 2020, at the iPhone 12 event. Designed to hold up to 3 cards, and attaches to the back of your iPhone.

MagSafe Wallet is shielded, so you have to pull your RFID / NFC cards out of it in order to tap them.

In 2021, the MagSafe Wallet was updated to include "Find My" capabilities. While it doesn't integrate with the broader [Find My network](https://developer.apple.com/find-my/), it can be linked to your Apple ID. As a result, if someone finds a lost wallet, they can view its associated information to help return it.
