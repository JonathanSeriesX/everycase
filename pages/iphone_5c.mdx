# iPhone 5c Case

In 2013, we witnessed an extraordinary moment: the release of the most vibrant iPhone yet, whose liveliness remains unbeaten to this day. Colourful iPhone 5c complemented your look and made you the centre of attention; the distinctiveness of this design ensured that if anyone forgot the phone in the office kitchen, there was no mistaking to _whom_ it belonged.

## Pricing & Compatibility

iPhone 5c Cases initially retailed for $29, but they quickly received discounts back in the day. Nevertheless, they remain easy to find due to the iPhone 5c's unfortunate lack of popularity.

These cases are only compatible with iPhone 5c.
