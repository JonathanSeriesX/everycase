# iPhone 12 case line-up

On October 13, 2020, Apple broadcasted a virtual event (remember COVID? Yeah, those times) dedicated to the iPhone 12, the HomePod mini, and a few other exciting announcements.

For the first time in human history, we got a phone you could actually hold comfortably in your hand.
I still cherish my iPhone 12 mini to this day—it’s a gem of a device.

And this time, both the mid-range and flagship models received full case treatment. Pretty solid event!

## Pricing & Compatibility

As has been the standard, the iPhone 12 Silicone Case and Clear Case were each listed at \$49, while the Leather Case carried a price of \$59.

These cases are not compatible with similar-looking iPhone 13, just like iPhone 12 is not perfectly compatible with iPhone 13 cases.
